                <!--Instructions on how to use the program-->
                <p> Instructions:</p>
                <p>Once clicking on the Start Program button a Terms and Conditions page will pop up. Upon agreeing to the terms and conditions the program will start. There will be a couple of options provided: Order, Make drink, and Add Stock. If a user clicks on the Make drink or Add Stock buttons they will be prompted for a password. This is to make sure that no faulty information is entered by a customer. <br><br>
                If the user clicks order a set of drink options will come up which they can choose from. Once the user has selected their desired drink and clicked order the system will see how much product needs to be subtracted from the stock and proceed to do so. <br><br>
                Upon clicking the make drink option the user will be able to enter a name of drink, the ingredients and the quantity of said ingredient in oz. Once the drink has been entered it will be entered into the system so that the customer will be able to order it on the order page. <br><br>
                Upon clicking the add stock button the user will be prompted for the stock to be entered and the amount to be added in oz once clicking submit this will be added to the stock. The system upon noticing stock getting low will send out a message for the user to be aware that more of the ingredient needs to be ordered.</p>
